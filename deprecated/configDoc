Redeye predictions are based on validation dataset.

Makefile will generate the path files in configs, and call src helpers to modify paths in certain scripts.
Everything must strictly follow this hierarchy.
Modify files:
model files: solver.prototxt train_val.prototxt deploy.prototxt(if has one) must be under the same folder with full path specified in config.
Need to specify the caffe folder directory as well, if want caffe and this folder separated.

To compile with new layers:
~/caffe/build/src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.h ( this is already built file. modify proto instead )
~/caffe/src/caffe/layer_factory.cpp ( this can be a choice to modify as well )
~/caffe/src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto
~/caffe/include/caffe/layers/noise_layer.hpp & energy_loss_layer.hpp
~/caffe/src/caffe/layers/noise_layer.cpp & noise_layer.cu & energy_loss...

To compile, make sure CXXFLAGS and NVCCFLAGS are using correct CXX lib in Makefile:
CXXFLAGS += -MMD -MP -std=c++11
NVCCFLAGS += ... -std=c++11
PY(PROJECT)-SO: $(Q)$(CXX) -std=c++11 -shared -o ...


After make pycaffe, copy the python/caffe directory to the python module path: /usr/lib/python2.7
